# razoyo_carprofile
Razoyo developer test

Notes:
1. The UI is best effort considering I am not a designer and was not provided with design mock-ups.
2. The db structure could have been better but due to time constraints I chose the quickest implementation.
3. Overall the solution it could be more optimized but due to time constraints it is best effort.
4. I could have chosen a hierarchical dropdown model, but went for a single dropdown to speed up development.
5. Car selection and saving are ajax based, so a traditional form was not used.
